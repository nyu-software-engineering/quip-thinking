## Team Roles (Jody)

- **Product Owner and Scrum Master**
  - Everyone had a chance to be the product owner and scrum master once
- **Developer**
  - Everyone was a developer during every sprint
  - We split up the labor based upon who felt more comfortable working on certain features
    - If someone had more knowledge about one subject they would focus on the work involving that

## Project Summary (Larry)

**Quip Thinking**
- **Elevator Pitch**
  - Quip Thinking is a game based off of Quiplash, a popular game originally developed at Jackbox Games
  - The original involves people answering witty prompts and their friends voting on the better answer
  - Quip Thinking allows users to play with anyone from the comfort of their computers or phones
  - Players can join a public room or make their own private room with a room code to play with their friends
  - Users can also submit their own prompts (first vetted by us) to our database of prompts

## Users (Rebecca)

- **Audience**
  - We made this game for people of all ages
  - It can be played and enjoyed by people everywhere

- **Tendencies and Limitations**
  - We expected our audience to have a tendency to want to play Quiplash whenever and wherever they wanted
  - We would enable them to play without the limitation of a minimum number of people with them

- **What Need Does This Fill**
  - Some people don't want to pay for the original game, as it comes in a package alongside other games
  - Quip Thinking accommodates playing a quick game by yourself by joining a public room as well as the traditional means of playing with a group of friends

- **User Observation**
  - We have had people of different ages play our game
  - We made iterative changes to our project based on our observations and their feedback

- **Testing**
  - We have done in-person testing with our intended audience
  - We tested each component as we went along to ensure that it was functional and aesthetically pleasing

## The System (Disha)

- **Software**
  - HTML / CSS
  - JavaScript
  - Python (Web Scraping)
  - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js (MERN Stack)
  - Bootstrap / jQuery
  - Socket.IO

- **Hardware**
  - Standard Mac / PC Computers

- **Most Time-Consuming Aspect**
  - Connecting the frontend to the backend
  - We expected this to be straightforward so we saved it for the last sprint, but it turned out to be much more complicated than we thought (see challenges below)

## Challenges (Richard)

- **Incomplete Use Cases**
  - We didn't complete the use cases related to the public games
    - Table of active public games that can be joined
    - Creation of a public room that allows others to join

- **Expected Challenges**
  - Expectation: We thought we'd have the most difficulty with the actual development of the game in regards to the frontend (many of us were rusty with React) and backend (only one member was comfortable with databases)
  - Reality: Our expected challenges didn't actually occur due to the time we spent in Sprint 0 learning all of the information we were lacking; however, connecting the frontend and backend (learning Socket.IO) was very challenging as we didn't anticipate how much data we'd be passing back and forth

- **Biggest Challenge**
  - Connecting the Front End to the Back End
  - Consistently working on the project with different schedules and obligations (Agile likely would've worked much better in the real world, where this "job" is a priority)
  - It was difficult to learn other people's code since we all worked on our own things for the initial sprints

- **Overcoming Challenges**
  - We tried to overcome our challenges by having a few "hackathon" days, in which we all gathered to work on the project together for several hours
  - Couldn't complete as much as we wanted due to time constraints
  - Developed frontend and backend separately, then tried to link the two during the last spring
    - This proved to be the hardest part of the entire project and would require much more time than 1 Sprint to complete (if we had known this ahead of time, we would've reallocated our time differently and began integrating frontend to backend compatibility from the start)

## Lessons Learned (Disha)

- **Expected Amount of Work**
  - This project was much more difficult than we anticipated
  - None of us had experience with game design, much less interactive network-based games

- **New Software or Hardware**
  - Most of us hadn't worked with Socket.IO prior and needed to learn it

- **Takeaways**
  - Most of us specialized in certain areas, which led to problems when we needed to connect our code
  - We should have some breadth of knowledge of what our teammates our doing so we can help them if they run into obstacles and also make it easier to attach components
  - Extensive documentation would've made our lives much easier as there were many cases in which one person needed code that another had written, but didn't understand what the other person's code did

## The Future (Larry)

- **Beyond the Classroom**
  - This project could be useful outside of class as it provides entertainment and connects people to one another
  - Many people are unable to play the original game since they lack people to play with

- **Continued Work**
  - There may be some legal ramifications preventing us from actually developing and releasing the game
  - Unexpected difficulties arose with computer networks and the Internet of Things
