## Team Roles (Jody)

- **Product Owner and Scrum Master**
  - Everyone had a chance to be the product owner and scrum master once.
- **Developer**
  - Everyone was a developer during every sprint.
  - We split up the labor based upon who felt more comfortable working on certain features.
    - If someone had more knowledge about one subject they would focus on the work involving that.

## Project Summary (Larry)

**Quip Thinking**
- **Elevator Pitch**
  - Quip Thinking is a game based off of Quiplash, a popular game originally developed at Jackbox Games.
  - The original involves people answering witty prompts and their friends voting on the better answer.
  - Quip Thinking allows users to play with anyone from the comfort of their computers or phones.
  - Players can join a public room or make their own private room with a room code to play with their friends.
  - Users can also submit their own prompts (first vetted by us) to our database of prompts.
