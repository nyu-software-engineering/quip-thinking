  - Quip Thinking is a game based off of the popular game called Quiplash, originally made by the developers at Jackbox Games.
  - The original game involves two people answering witty prompts and their friends voting on which answer they liked the most. 
  - Quip Thinking puts a new spin on the game to give users a fresh take.
