  - Quip Thinking is a game based off of the popular game called Quiplash, originally made by the developers at Jackbox Games.
  - The original game involves two people answering witty prompts and their friends voting on which answer they liked the most. 
  - Quip Thinking puts a new spin on the game to give users a fresh take.
  - We give users the ability to play with anyone, from their friends to strangers, from the comfort of their computers or phones.
  - They can join a public room or make their own private room with a room code to play with their friends.
  - Users can also add their own prompts (first vetted by us!) to our database of prompts.
