                  Quip Thinking is all about coming up with the funniest
                  lines, to fun prompts! Just use your device to answer prompts, like: <br/><br/>
                  "The name of your new plumbing company"<br/><br/>
                  You can play with anyone, no matter where they are. If you only
                  want to play with friends and family, you can generate your
                  own private room code, like "XP2R" that they can use to join your room. If your
                  friends aren't online, you can always join a public room and play
                  with some potential new friends!

// <p>There are three rounds total, each with the same layout.
// Each person playing will get two prompts, and 60 seconds to
// come up with an answer for each. When everyone has given their
// answers, the prompts will be displayed, along with answers from
// two different people. Everyone, except the players who wrote answers,
// can vote on their favorite one. <br></br>
// After all the prompts have been cycled through, the current scores
// for the players are shown. Players can get double and triple the points
// in the second and third rounds. </p>
